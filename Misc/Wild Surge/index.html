  <h1>Wild Surge </h1>









<!-- Page content -->

    
        <p>Using the New Table</p>
<p>The rules are unchanged. When a sorcerer casts a spell, after the spell is cast, roll d20. If the result is 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. Other events or actions may also result in rolling on the table. However, instead of rolling d100 and going straight in, you must first roll d20 to determine which of the three columns you’re going to use. 1-3 (15%) is the first column (extreme), 4-9 (30%) is the middle column (moderate), and 10-20 (55%) is the third column (nuisance).</p>
<p>Optional rule: Instead of a flat 5% chance of Wild Magic Surges occurring when spells are cast, it was suggested that you roll d20 and subtract the level of the spell. If the result is 1 or less, a Wild Magic Surge occurs. This increases 1st level spells from 5% to 10%, increasing the odds by 5% each level.</p>
<p>A close review of the possible results will reveal that most of the effects in the original PHB table appear in this table as well. However, most of the results are new and this table has undergone moderate playtesting in my groups.<br />
Table: Revised Wild Magic Surge d20/d100    1-3/Extreme     4-9/Moderate    10-20/Nuisance<br />
1   Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.    Roll on this table twice immediately.   Reroll on this table.<br />
2   You recover all your expended spell slots.  You are confused for 1 minute, as though you were affected by the confusion spell.  You levitate 6 inches off the ground for 1 minute.<br />

A third eye appears in your forehead, giving you advantage on sight-based Wisdom (Perception) checks for 1 minute.  You make no sounds for 1 minute and you gain advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<br />
5   You teleport to an alternate plane, then return to the location where you started after 1 minute.   The next spell you cast within the next minute that does damage, the damage is maximized.   You grow a beard made of feathers, which remains until you sneeze.</p>
<p>6   You transform into a large empty barrel for 1 minute, during which time you considered petrified.   For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as part of your movement on each of your turns.     You can't speak for 1 minute. When you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth.</p>
<p>7   You are at the center of a darkness spell for 1 minute.     You become intoxicated for 2d6 hours.   You are immune to intoxication for the next 5d6 days.</p>
<p>8   You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn.     Your Intelligence is decreased by 2 for 1 day.  You recover your lowest-level expended spell slot.</p>
<p>9   You are resistant to all damage types for 1 minute.     Your Wisdom is increased by 2 for 1 day.    For the next minute, you must shout when you speak.<br />
10  A random creature within 60 feet of you is poisoned for 1d4 hours.  For 1 minute, any flammable item you touch, that you aren't already wearing or carrying, bursts into flame.     Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air around you in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute.</p>
<p>11  Make a Wisdom saving throw against your own spell save DC. If you fail, you are polymorphed into giant dragonfly for 1 minute.  Plants grow around you and you are restrained for 1 minute.

14  You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.     If you fall within the next day, you automatically have the benefit of the feather fall spell.  Your hair grows to double its current length over the next minute.<br />
15  You are the center of a silence spell for 1 minute.     You recover 1 expended spell slot of your choice.   Your hair falls out but grows back within 1 day.<br />
16  You are vulnerable to fiends for 1 hour. Such creatures gain advantage on attack rolls made against you.    For the next spell you cast within 1 minute that does damage, the damage is minimized.  You gain the ability to speak one additional language of your choice for 1 hour.<br />
17  For the next day, any time you make an ability check, roll 1d6 and subtract the result.     You have are surrounded by a spectral shield for 1 minute, giving you a +2 bonus to your AC and immunity to magic missile.  You are invisible for 1 minute.<br />
18  For any spell that requires a saving throw you cast within the next minute, the target gains advantage.     You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for 1 minute.     Your eyes permanently change color. If they are a blue or grey shade, they turn dark brown, or vice versa. A spell such as remove curse can end this effect.<br />
19  The next single target spell you cast within the next minute must target one additional target.     For 1 minute, you gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.     Small birds flutter and chirp in your vicinity for 1 minute, during which time you automatically fail any Stealth check.<br />
20  A demon whose CR is equal to your level appears near you. Make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If you make it, the demon is subservient, otherwise, it is hostile. The demon, if not banished or defeated, vanishes after 1 day.    You are protected from Elementals for 1 hour. Such creatures cannot attack you or harm you unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.   You feel the incredible urge to relieve yourself. Until you do, your Strength and Intelligence are reduced by 1. If you don't relieve yourself in the next 2 minutes, the above effects are removed, but your Charisma score is reduced by 4 for 1 hour or until you change your trousers.<br />
21  For the next minute, every creature within 60 feet of you that hears you speak only hears insults as if you are casting vicious mockery at first level.     For the next minute, one creature of your choice gets a -2 penalty to its AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls.   Gnats buzz around your head for 1 minute, distracting you.

For the next minute, all spells with a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action require 2 consecutive actions to cast.<br />
24  For 1 minute, a duplicate of yourself appears in the nearest open space which can take actions independently, and goes on the same Initiative as you. However, any damage it takes as well as any spell slots or sorcery point it uses applies to you as well.  For the next hour, you gain advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with any creature wearing black, but disadvantage if they are wearing white. If they are wearing both, this doesn't apply.    You have the irresistible urge to scratch an itch in the middle your back, just out of reach, for 1 minute. If you don't scratch it using a back scratcher or some similar device , you must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to cast a spell.<br />
25  A loud boom emanates from you. All creatures within 15 feet take 2d8 thunder damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be deafened for 1 minute.

34  Choose 1 permanent or triggered effect that has happened to you or somebody else that you’ve received from this chart and remove it, even if it was beneficial.     You gain the service of an arcane eye for 1 minute that does not require concentration.     A magic mouth appears on a nearby wall or flat surface.
